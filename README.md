**What is CSS Calculator**?

*CSS Calculator is a project which takes advantage of CSS's native CSS custom properties (aka "CSS Variables") to attempt to create a functional calculator.*

**Wait, functional calculator**?

*Yes, that's what I said.*

**But hold on, CSS isn't a programming language!**

*Technically HTML+CSS are Turing Complete, so you can technically "program" in it. Only issue is having to work with certain aspects of general programming (loops, conditionals, comparisons) in a whole new light.*

**So, how would you do most of this?**

*I'm working this out as I go along. There are certian aspects of the way CSS variables work that allow you to take advantage of conditionals based on Boolean logic, which in turn can be reduced down to mathematical equations that involve multiplication, subtraction and addition; stuff that the **CSS calc()** is quite capable of doing with css variables. I will be explaining the first part of my repo very soon. Stay tuned.*

**What is CSS Calculator**?

*CSS Calculator is a project which takes advantage of CSS's native CSS custom properties (aka "CSS Variables") to attempt to create a functional calculator.*

**Wait, functional calculator**?

*Yes, that's what I said.*

**But hold on, CSS isn't a programming language!**

*Technically HTML+CSS are Turing Complete, so you can technically "program" in it. Only issue is having to work with certain aspects of general programming (loops, conditionals, comparisons) in a whole new light.*

**So, how would you do most of this?**

*CSS3 now makes use of two functions, **calc()** and **var()** which allow **CSS variables** (also called CSS Custom properties) to be implemented. This is similar to the variables that are available to SASS and LESS CSS pre-compilers. The only difference is that CSS variables can be manipulated in real time.*

*With that in mind, you can build a series of registers to hold binary place-holders (1's and 0's) and then using a series of mathematical equations implemented by either variable assignment using **var()** or through calculation using a combination of **var()** and **calc()**, mimic specific functions like performing logic gate functions like **AND** and **OR**, or even perform carry-over or carry-back functions to perform addition and subtraction.*
